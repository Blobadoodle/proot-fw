# ProotFW

ProotFW is the firmware that I use for my protogen, which is based on an ESP32-S3 and MAX7219 displays.\
This is still very much a WIP, lacking many features!.\
Currently this firwmare is designed for the following hardware (running on a [ProS3](https://esp32s3.com/pros3.html)):

- 14x MAX7219/7221 displays
- 128x128 SH1107 OLED internal display
- 2x 37 pixel WS2812B/Neopixel rings (24 outer, 12 inner, 1 centre)
- MAX9814 microphone
- APDS9960 gesture sensor for boop detection
- 1x PWM fan control
- Battery percentage detection
- Single button control interface for expression changing & settings
